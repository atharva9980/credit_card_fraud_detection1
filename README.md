The project addressed a highly imbalanced dataset by first handling null values to ensure data integrity. Imbalance was mitigated using techniques such as oversampling the minority class. Feature scaling was applied to normalize the data, which is essential for algorithms like logistic regression. Cross-validation was employed to evaluate and compare the performance of a decision tree and logistic regression, ultimately achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.97%. This rigorous approach ensured robust and reliable model selection.
